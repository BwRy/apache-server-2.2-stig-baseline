  title "The httpd.conf MaxClients directive must be set properly."
  desc  "These requirements are set to mitigate the effects of several types of
denial of service attacks. Although there is some latitude concerning the
settings themselves, the requirements attempt to provide reasonable limits for
the protection of the web server. If necessary, these limits can be adjusted to
accommodate the operational requirement of a given system.

    From Apache.org: The MaxClients directive sets the limit on the number of
simultaneous requests that will be served. Any connection attempts over the
MaxClients limit will normally be queued, up to a number based on the
ListenBacklog directive. Once a child process is freed at the end of a
different request, the connection will then be serviced.

    For non-threaded servers (i.e., prefork), MaxClients translates into the
maximum number of child processes that will be launched to serve requests. The
default value is 256; to increase it, you must also raise ServerLimit.

    For threaded and hybrid servers (e.g. beos or worker) MaxClients restricts
the total number of threads that will be available to serve clients. The
default value for beos is 50. For hybrid MPMs the default value is 16
(ServerLimit) multiplied by the value of 25 (ThreadsPerChild). Therefore, to
increase MaxClients to a value that requires more than 16 processes, you must
also raise ServerLimit.

If the directive is set improperly, this is a finding.

If the directive does not exist, this is NOT a finding because it will default
to 256.  It is recommended that the directive be explicitly set to prevent
unexpected results if the defaults change with updated software.

NOTE: This vulnerability can be documented locally with the ISSM/ISSO if the
site has operational reasons for the use of increased value. If the site has
this documentation, this should be marked as Not a Finding.
