  title "A web server must be segregated from other services."
  desc  "The web server installation and configuration plan should not support
the co-hosting of multiple services such as Domain Name Service (DNS), e-mail,
databases, search engines, indexing, or streaming media on the same server that
is providing the web publishing service.  By separating these services
additional defensive layers are established between the web service and the
applicable application should either be compromised.

    Disallowed or restricted services in the context of this vulnerability
applies to services that are not directly associated with the delivery of web
content. An operating system that supports a web server will not provide other
services (e.g., domain controller, e-mail server, database server, etc.). Only
those services necessary to support the web server and its hosted sites are
specifically allowed and may include, but are not limited to, operating system,
logging, anti-virus, host intrusion detection, administrative maintenance, or
network requirements.
